QUIC seeks to understand quantitatively the subtle interplay of quantum phenomena in insulators and conductors, and lay the foundations for the design of the quantum materials of tomorrow. In QUIC we study fundamental mechanisms governing insulators and conductors by using quantum simulators, based on fully controllable ultracold gases, including disordered and strongly correlated. The project uses in great extent high quality random number generators (RNG), inclusive the best quantum RNGs.\r\nQUIC combines for the first time advanced manipulation techniques of ultracold atomic gases, innovative theoretical ideas of condensed-matter physics and quantum-information methods. The immediate goals of our project are to understand quantitatively the subtle interplay of quantum phenomena in insulators and conductors, explore new promising directions for the engineering of transport in real materials, and lay the foundations for the design of the quantum materials of tomorrow.\r\nAs said above designing and realizing QS of complex systems is the playground for using abstraction as a meta-method.

The devices come with expertise in analysing randomness and pseudo-randomness, predictability of time sequences etc. Contemporary music uses frequently RNGs (aleatorism, serialism, spectral music). Free improvised music can also be viewed from a point of view of predictability.\r\n2) We have expertise in designing and building models of complex physical reality - quantum simulators, in theory and in experiment. Here the abstraction from details is the main methodological principle, which has many analogies to abstraction in contemporary music.", "objectives_description": "1) In the question of randomness it has already been investigated how random and predictable people can be (The Big Bell test).

Fluid Dynamics (FD) simulations provide a powerful tool for the analysis of such fluid flows and are an essential element of many industrial and academic problems. The complexities and nature of fluid flows, often combined with problems set in open domains, implies that the resources needed to computationally model problems of industrial and academic relevance is virtually unbounded.

In an experiment-theory enterprise, we will engineer several different kinds of such synthetic quantum matter, where we can isolate and study quantitatively the quantum phenomena and phases.\r\nWe will not only study the physics of real systems, such as disordered and strongly-correlated superconductors and superfluids, but we will also create systems that do not exist so far in nature, such as topological phases in graphene-like lattices.

This requires an understanding of the basic hardware units and methods to program the ensemble that scales up to millions of components. \r\nTo ensure that the hardware is possible, we will build an autonomous, centimetre-scale, mass-producible modular robot, using conventional and non-conventional fabrication techniques. In doing so, we aim to create the atomic unit of programmable matter that can be scaled to very large numbers of modules. We also aim to establish fundamental methods that will enable the manufacture of three-dimensional, freestanding centimeter-size-robots, and develop new methods for analysis for power transfer between capacitively coupled systems.\r\nThe realization of even a rudimentary implementation of programmable matter requires each robot to be able to perform some basic functions. In addition to computation, these functions include a mechanism to gather energy, since it would be better to avoid batteries in a large ensemble of robots. Another basic function is that each micro-robot should have the ability to latch onto its neighbours to create larger structures. These connections may also serve as a mean to communicate with neighbouring robots. Robots should also encompass an actuation mechanism, which will enable them to move within an ensemble, allowing the autonomous and dynamic formation of configurations. The goal of this work is to show that all of these functions can be implemented in an efficient way, using a single mechanism.\r\nThe individual unit, while interesting in its own right, is not particularly useful unless we can program it---and all the other units in the ensemble---to achieve a useful global goal. Previous approaches to this have often required the programmer to reason explicitly about the individual units, e.g., for synchronization, communication, memory mapping, etc. The resulting programs are often buggy, hard to maintain, and inefficient. Meld which is an implicitly parallel logic-based programming language that has been shown to be inherently fault tolerant, concise, expressive and efficient, will be the basis of our work. Meld has been used to create a generalized shape transformation algorithm; which was formally (and automatically) proven to be both sound and complete. Meld will be enhanced for the purpose of this project.\r\n\r\nThe application will consist in sculpting a sheet of a shape-memory polymer. Indeed, by moving relatively one to each other the modules will deform the polymer sheet put on top of them. This sheet will then be rigidified by changing the ambient temperature such that the final state will be kept. If the temperature is changed again, the polymer could be sculpted again.

Departing from technocratic planning, the shaping of the urban realm will become a democratic process in which all civic stakeholders participate as co-creators and co-designers. From the very beginning of a project, citizen experts will contribute their experience, opinions, and ideas, and keep an active voice throughout the design and development process. Positive public commitment, constructive discussion, and high identification with projects will result this new kind of co-creation.\r\nDifferent cases of public disagreement in different European countries have shown recently that perusing a thorough planning process is by no means a guarantee for a broad public acceptance of an envisioned urban project. The measures already in place to inform the public and collect eventual disagreement are based on classical media and require to lookup plans and project descriptions during the opening hours of municipal offices where those materials are at display. This procedure becomes quite off the perception of today\u2019s citizens more and more. Public planning administration and the public itself need to have a platform for sharing and further evolving projects of common interest in order to perceive each other as partners in a collaborative process. Having this vision in mind, U_CODE aims to be the conceptual, organizational and technical platform for enabling exactly this.\r\nWhereas many tools for e-participation have been developed and tested already in order to involve citizens and large stakeholder groups, there are no digital instruments yet which enable the creative participation of the citizenship on a massive scale. This is the challenge for the new co-design environment U_CODE: it enables communication and collaboration between large numbers of citizen and professional experts, and thus ensures a substantially more creative, focused, and secure design process for projects of high public concern.\r\nThe first key novelty of U_CODE is a Public Project Space for non-professional civic users. Here a highly accessible, low-threshold public interface is provided that addresses an audience ranging from school kids to elderly people. Information about projects is presented in understandable and transparent manner. Moreover, for citizens who want to engage actively in the design process by creating design ideas and contributing comments, a \u201cProject Playground\u201d is provided which features highly experiential design and communication tools. Based on gaming approaches and accessible with mobile devices, the tools on this creative play station are easy to handle and entertaining, in order to stimulate maximum participation. Natural interfaces with gesture and motion control allow intuitive modelling, instant visualisation, and even rapid prototyping. Further, the playground provides commenting and voting functions that allow quick assessment of ideas and proposals.\r\nThe second key novelty of U_CODE is a communication and collaboration platform which connects the public \u201cProject Play Ground\u201d to professional studios of experts e.g. urban designers, architects, and developers. Based on participative methodology and state-of-the-art collaborative tools and technologies, this Co-design Workspace is designed as unidirectional exchange hub between public users and professionals. Especially in the crucial early phase of the design and development process, this new type of participative interface supports the collection of project relevant information, the generation of initial impulses, and the sharing and discussion of design propositions. It provides valuable feedback about ongoing and future projects not only to professional creatives like designers and planners, but also for stakeholders like public authorities, planning agencies, and real estate developers.\r\nKey catalysers for co-design and communication are Moderated Models (MoM) that are exchanged and iterated between professionals and the public until mutual understanding is found. The Moderated Models are derivatives from Project Information Models (PIM) which integrate all project relevant information, including technical data as well as public input on the Data Space, a data analytics engine. User-oriented, understandable MoM break down the complexity of technical models to appropriate level of detail; they ensure security of data and the project by responsibly directing information to audiences and contributors; and they maintain soundness of the planning and development process in legal, technical, and economic terms. Moderated models are published in the public Project Play Ground to stimulate feedback e.g. via Social Media. Feedback, in turn, will be analysed and edited by U_CODE to inform the further design work. Specifically, U_CODE will assess the proposals on semantic and emotional level, in order to devise early detection of resistance against projects, and to prevent the build-up of negative public sentiment. \r\nIn effect, U_CODE will enable professional creatives to utilise the public\u00b4s creativity, to follow public opinions and sentiments, and to derive design intelligence from them.

The computing efficiency will be moreover demonstrated on real-world complex technological tasks, instead of usual standard academic benchmarks, thus demonstrating the actual efficiency and applicability of the unconventional approach. These tasks consist of diagnostic and prognostic of fuel cell stacks, and control of the transverse profile of a femtosecond laser machining system. They were chosen because they can not be solved currently with conventional digital computers. \r\nThe concept of this bio-inspired computer is known in the literature as Reservoir Computer (RC), or also Echo State Network, or even Liquid State Machine. The PI recently developed this approach with photonic hardware, in the framework of a successful EU FET project. The project led to the world first photonic Reservoir, i.e. the first hardware demonstration for the processing core of a RC. It was highlighted in Nature Physics, Nature Photonics, and Optics & Photonics Focus. The aim of BiPhoProc is to demonstrate the first complete photonic RC system, moreover with the capability to solve real-wold complex technological problems.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project consists of a twofold strongly unconventional approach: (i) the computational concept in itself (RC) is not yet widely addressed, despite many successful achievements (the PI's group is the only one in France having already successfully addressed a hardware demonstration of RC); (ii) the physical implementation of such RC concept is also strongly unusual, since it makes use of an optoelectronic nonlinear delay dynamics as the Reservoir classically consisting of a neural network or a network of dynamical nodes. This high risk unconventional purely temporal architecture is however expected to provide efficient practical solutions where the neural network architecture is facing hard experimental difficulties related to the connectivity between the spatial nodes of the network. Delay dynamics practically emulate in the time domain, a virtual spatial dimension, allowing then to use various signal processing tools to implement complex neural network processing functionalities (e.g. input layer connectivity can be realized through time division multiplexing, a well known technique in information transmission).\r\nOpen issues to be addressed within the project are numerous, since currently obtained results are concerning the Reservoir only, but a whole self-consistent RC processor is far from being operational. This latter point is the main challenge of the project. To successfully achieve it, several points will need to be solved: Encoding of the input information will need to be properly identified and optimized with respect to the delay dynamics properties; The so-called input mask for input information injection into the delay Reservoir will need to be deterministically derived with respect to the addressed problem; The output layer and the hardware implementation of the corresponding Read-Out also consists in an open problem (off-line algorithm only are currently used to perform RC), which requires a physical solution if one needs to perform fast real-time RC processing; The photonic Reservoir itself was demonstrated to be operational, however currently at the cost of a complex parameter optimization procedure: universal (problem-independent) hardware architecture is still missing, and will need to be addressed.", "affiliation": "FEMTO-ST Institute, CNRS & Univ.

The demand for high performance computing experts in the area of simulation, modeling and programming as well as performance optimization is high and will continue to grow with the further expansion of digitization.

However, C/C composites suffer from poor erosion resistance while silicon-based ceramics (SiC/SiC or C/SiC composites) may lead to ablation due to the formation and volatilization of silica. Indeed, above 1600 \u00b0C they begin to soften and in low oxygen atmospheres they develop a substantial vapor pressure while the active oxidation of SiC may lead to extensive damage due to the occurrence of unpredictable surface temperature jumps. \r\nIn recent years, Ultra High Temperature Ceramics UHTCs such as borides and carbides of early transition metals, have shown outstanding erosion resistance at temperatures up to 2000 C or even higher but they still cannot resist to thermal shocks and damage. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for advanced materials with temperature capability in highly corrosive environments for aerospace to enable space vehicles to resist several launches and reentries.

The EU-funded project C3HARME aims to combine the best features of CMCs and UHTCs to design, develop, manufacture and test a new class of Ultra High Temperature Ceramic Matrix Composite (UHTCMCs) with self-healing capabilities. The latter should arise from the in-situ formation of adherent and ultra-refractory oxide scales. The incorporation of nano-sized ceramic dopants in the material will further protect the oxide scale in severe conditions. \r\nC3HARME has selected two applications to implement the new material:\r\n1.\tRockets nozzles of solid/hybrid rocket motors \u2013 that must survive harsh thermochemical and mechanical environment produced by high performance solid propellants during launch (2.700-3.000 \u00b0C)\r\n2.\tTiles forming the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of hypersonic vehicles - that should resist very high heat fluxes and thermo-mechanical stresses during launch and re-entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \r\n\r\nC3HARME project will produce the needed innovative material solutions by integrating existing and well-established techniques for CMCs and UHTCs production.

This approach is called \u201cnetwork-based biocomputation\u201d. Whenever the biomolecules reach a junction in the network, they can decide to take a turn, which adds a number to the sum they are calculating or to continue straight on, which does not add a number. That way, each biomolecule acts as a tiny computer with processor and memory. While an individual biomolecule is much slower than a current computer, they are self-assembling so that they can be used in large numbers, quickly adding up their computing power.\r\nAs said above, besides finding creative solutions for our research challenges, we are also expecting to make this rather narrow research field known to a wider public and to motivate more researchers to go into this research field. Two major goals of this project are: \r\n(i)\tto generate and structure a larger interdisciplinary community addressing theoretical and technological aspects and identifying future applications, and \r\n(ii)\tto develop a functional innovation eco-system that has the capability to address all levels of the value chain, from basic research to market success. \r\nThe tools that researchers have available are limited in the capacity to reach out (e.g. workshops are limited by number of participants, websites are only passive communication). Therefore, the public attention that follows with both, the artistic creation and the creation process, is extremely valuable for the success of generating a larger research community and a functional innovation ecosystem. \r\nThe specific research challenges are \r\n(1) to design the junctions in an error-free way: the networks are etched into silicon chips by electron beam lithography. At junctions it can happen, that biomolecules get stuck or only take one direction although two are possible (straight or turn). We believe that changes in the channel and junction geometries can improve the error rate. Also, we are looking into possibilities to include tunnels and overpasses so that the number of possible paths for the biomolecules is restricted. This will be done with 3D laser writing. Here, we propose the artist to work with TU Dresden and Fraunhofer ENAS in order to inspire artistic designs and channel/junction designs. \r\n(2) to find a possibility for increase the number of biomolecules during the passage through the network: with only one entrance the number of biomolecules that can be fed into the network is limited. However, the number of channels increases with increasing size of the network (which in turn reflects the complexity of the computation problem). Therefore we are exploring possibilities to cut or otherwise divide the biomolecules during the passage. Here, we propose the artist to work with Linnaeus University and TU Dresden to inspire each other. \r\n(3) to detect which of the biomolecules have taken a correct path through the network by a) chemical/physical detection methods and b) developing verification algorithms. If we e.g. look at the \u201ctravelling salesman\u201d problem, we want to make sure that the biomolecules have visited all \u201ctowns\u201d only once. Therefore, we are researching possibilities to mark the biomolecules in some way specific for each town visited. Here, we propose the artist to work with Lund University. Especially markers that can be detected by light/fluorescence microscopy have been discussed. As light and colour are important elements of art, we expect that both, the researchers and the artist will be inspired. Verification algorithms will be developed by partner Bar Ilan University. The algorithms could e.g. give an estimate of the time that biomolecules must spend in the network if they have explored the network in a correct way.

A very relevant objective for weDRAW is to exploit art (with a particular focus on music and drawing) for teaching arithmetic and geometry to primary school children.\r\nweDRAW comes from the renewed neuroscientific understanding of the role of communication between sensory modalities during development: specific sensory systems have specific roles to learn specific concepts.

Furthermore, a constantly increasing amount of multimedia content, originally released with traditional copyright licenses, is becoming public domain as its copyright expires. However, we believe that the professional creative industries (e.g. videogames, film and music industries) are not yet using much of all this content in their media productions.\r\nThere are a number of reasons why such content is not yet extensively used in the professional sector. We think that a major one is the lack of a shared culture within the creative industries of open content and its potential use. But there are also technical and practical issues that do not facilitate this usage. Despite the amount of Creative Commons audio content available in online repositories such as Jamendo or Freesound, other potentially useful content remains scattered around the web (if available at all) and typically not properly labeled with specific licenses or reachable through search engines. Also, the nature of this content, coming from a variety of sources and from authors with different levels of expertise, results in unstructured (or not uniformly structured) mass of resources, limiting its potential retrieval and reuse possibilities. Moreover, no tools are easily available to search and incorporate Creative Commons audio content in the production workflows of the creative industries.\r\nThe Audio Commons Initiative is therefore aimed at promoting the use of open audio content and at developing technologies with which to support an envisioned ecosystem of content repositories, production tools and users (the Audio Commons Ecosystem). These technologies should enable the reuse of this audio material, facilitating its integration in the production workflows of the creative industries.\r\nWe envision a technology supported ecosystem of content, users and tools that should facilitate the reuse of Creative Commons audio content in the professional sector and, by extension, in the independent or non-professional sectors too. We call this the Audio Commons Ecosystem (or ACE). In short, the Audio Commons Ecosystem will allow content creators to expose their Creative Commons audio content to content users in the creative industries, and provide ways for its seamless integration in creative workflows. \r\nAudio content created by the content creators will be exposed in the ACE through a number of content providers. Content providers will host that content and publish it following a common metadata specification as defined by an audio ontology (the Audio Commons ontology), and make it available to content users through embeddable tools (e.g.,~audio plug-ins) developed by tool developers. Content providers will be able to communicate with the embeddable tools through a unified API specification (the Audio Commons API specification) which will not only manage information about audio content and retrieval but also will handle licensing procedures between content creators and content users. Furthermore, because of the nature of Creative Commons licenses, content users will also be able to become content creators by feeding back derivative or new content to the ecosystem. The procedures for publishing and consuming content, as well as the tools for annotating content and the ontology and API specifications, will be open and made available to the public and to potential new actors willing to join the ecosystem.\r\nThe technologies needed to support this ecosystem will be developed within the AudioCommons project, including some embeddable tools developed by industrial partners of the consortium. However, most of the components to support such an ecosystem do in fact already exist in a form or another. There already exist sound sharing platforms such as Jamendo, Freesound, cc-Mixter (potential Audio Commons content providers) and others that host Creative Commons audio content and that have APIs through which it can be retrieved by third-party applications. There exist a number of tools for annotating audio content (some supported by the members of the consortium), and there exist some tools for the creative industries which integrate Creative Commons content from online platforms such as Ardour, a digital audio workstation which can directly retrieve content from Freesound. The ecosystem that we want to support will therefore be rooted in existing and successful technologies.\r\nIn order to make Creative Commons audio content reusable in the creative industries there are some clearly defined issues that can be faced through the research and development of new technologies and improvement of existing ones.

The field needs fresh approaches to discover novel patient-friendly therapies that are more efficient, safer and heart-specific. The EU-funded project CUPIDO started in February 2017, proposes to apply nanotechnologies to the cardiovascular field. CUPIDO aims to hit the core of the cardiovascular disease, developing inhalable nanoparticles that can deliver as simple as breathing a therapeutic directly to the diseased heart. To achieve the goal, the CUPIDO consortium is working to develop biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles that can self-assemble and encapsulate drugs, novel or available, in a suitable format for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The route of the nanoparticles is quite complex and includes several stages:\r\n\r\n1.\tNanoparticle preparation:  the selected particles are negatively charged calcium phosphate CaP nanoparticles that can encapsulate bioactive molecules and function as an effective drug-delivery system through the formation of life-compatible nanopores that allow cellular internalization. Nanoparticles are generated through an easy and self-assembling process consisting of the mixing of two saline solutions followed by a washing step via dialysis. \r\n\r\n2.\tNano-embedded microparticle production, inhalation, and lung deposition: unlike nano-sized materials (1 nm - 1\u00b5m), particles in the range between 1-3 \u00b5m can be efficiently deposited at the alveolar level. CaPs will, therefore, be transformed into a microparticle dry powder that can be easily inhaled and reach the deep lung.\r\n\r\n3.\tNano-embedded microparticle dissolution in the lung, nanoparticle release and translocation to the heart: once inhaled the microparticles can dissolve in the lung fluid. During respiration, the oxygenated blood moves from the pulmonary circulation first to the heart via the pulmonary vein. In line with this, the inhaled CaPs able to cross the alveolar-capillary barrier would rapidly reach the myocardium. \r\n\r\n4.\tMonitoring and guidance to the heart: the fate of CaPs and the effective biodistribution will be monitored in vivo through radio- and fluorescence-labeling to select the most promising delivery systems. To achieve selective drug delivery to myocardial cells and reduce the adverse side effects, CUPIDO will implement aptamers as cardiac-specific carriers and magnetic guidance applying a stable magnetic field.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, CUPIDO will address cardiovascular diseases associated with structural and functional impairment of the myocardium presenting a reduced systolic function (i.e. Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction - HFrEF).

Furthermore, we are going to test them in cooperation with the cities of Stuttgart and Herrenberg in a so called \u201eReallabor\u201c (Urban Transition Lab), which means that research will take place in urban environments.\r\n\r\nProject partners:\r\nHigh Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS), University of Stuttgart;\r\nInstitute of Human Factors and Technology Management (IAT), University of Stuttgart;\r\nFaculty of Architecture and Urban Design (SI), University of Stuttgart;\r\nStuttgart Research Center for Interdisciplinary Risk and Innovation Studies (ZIRIUS), University of Stuttgart;\r\nFraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering (IAO), Stuttgart;\r\nThe cities of Stuttgart and Herrenberg.", "affiliation": "State Ministry of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for Sciences, Research and Arts", "commitment_letter": "user/documents/2017/04/10/LoC_ReallaborStadtquartier_4.0.pdf", "persons": "Myriam Guedey (HLRS), Dr. Uwe W\u00f6ssner (HLRS), Mike Letzgus (IAT)"}}, {"model": "organization-projects.projectprivatedata", "pk": 20, "fields": {"project": null, "description": "When I asked my seven-year-old daughter \"Who is the boy in your class\r\nwho was also new in school last year, like you?\", she instantly\r\nreplied \"Daniel\", using the descriptive content in my utterance to\r\nidentify an entity in the real world and refer to it. The ability to\r\nuse language to refer to reality is crucial for humans, and yet it is\r\nvery difficult to model. AMORE breaks new ground in Computational\r\nLinguistics, Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence by developing a\r\nmodel of linguistic reference to entities implemented as a\r\ncomputational system that can learn its own representations from data.\r\n\r\nReference is both fuzzy and discrete. When we refer to an object in\r\nthe world with the linguistic expression \"the mug I bought\", we use\r\ncontent words such as \"mug\", which are notoriously fuzzy or vague in\r\ntheir meaning. Once the referent for the mug has been established,\r\nhowever, it becomes a linguistic entity that we can manipulate in a\r\nlargely discrete fashion, retrieving it and updating it with new\r\ninformation as needed (\"remember the mug I bought? My brother stole\r\nit!\"). Thus, handling reference requires two distinct abilities:\r\n\r\n1) The ability to categorize, that is, to recognize that different\r\nentities are equivalent with regard to some parameter of interest (for\r\ninstance, two mugs, or two instances of the \"things to take on a\r\ncamping trip\" category). This implies being able to put diverse things\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n2) The ability to individuate, that is, to keep entities\r\ndistinct even if they are similar with regard to many properties\r\n(for instance, two pieces of pink granite that were collected in different\r\nnational parks). This implies being able to keep similar things apart.\r\n\r\nOur project builds on two complementary traditions, each exceling at\r\none of the two aspects while struggling with the other one. AMORE\r\nsynthesizes the two approaches into a unified model that emulates both\r\nfuzzy and discrete properties of language, and is able to learn to\r\nrefer directly from examples.\r\n\r\nThe model is a computer program that is able to carry out referential\r\ntasks, matching linguistic expressions (\"the Medicine student\", \"the\r\nwhite cat\") with entities in the real world such as objects depicted\r\nin images. We obtain it using Machine Learning. Computer programs tell\r\ncomputers how to carry out tasks, as if you gave a recipe to your\r\nneighbor and he baked a cake by following the instructions. Machine\r\nLearning enables computers to learn the recipe themselves by\r\nobservation, as if your neighbor watched you baking a cake and then\r\nmade one himself back at home.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in AMORE we give the computer a collection of images\r\ndepicting different entities (say, two boys and one table), and we\r\ntell it that if we ask for \"the table\" it should retrieve the image of\r\nthe table, but if we ask for \"the boy\" it should complain that we\r\ndidn't get our language right, because there are two boys. By\r\ncrunching thousands of examples, the model is able to generalize to\r\nsituations it has never encountered.\r\n\r\nAMORE is organized into three main parts:\r\n\r\n1) Developing the model. The main novelty is the use of a memory\r\nmodule to dynamically add entity representations as they are\r\nencountered in language and in visual input, update them, and retrieve\r\nthem as needed.\r\n\r\n2) Testing it in referential tasks involving only language. For\r\ninstance, given a story that starts \"Bob is a Law student, but Ann\r\nstudies Medicine\", and then goes on to talk about Mark and Barbara and\r\nwhat happens to all of these characters, the system should output\r\n\"Ann\" in response to the question \"Who is the Medicine student?\".\r\n\r\n3) Testing it in referential tasks involving language and perception,\r\nspecifically vision. For instance, we give the computer a collection\r\nof images depicting different entities (say, two boys and one table),\r\nand we tell it that if we ask for \"the table\" it should retrieve the\r\nimage of the table, but if we ask for \"the boy\" it should complain\r\nthat we didn't get our language right, because there are two boys.\r\n\r\nAMORE advances our scientific understanding of language and its\r\ncomputational modeling, and contributes to the far-reaching debate\r\nbetween discrete and fuzzy approaches to cognition with an\r\nintegrative proposal.", "affiliation": "Universitat Pompeu Fabra", "commitment_letter": "user/documents/2017/04/10/letter-commitment-vertigo_loc_v3.pdf", "persons": "Gemma Boleda, Louise McNally, Carina Silberer, Matthijs Westera, Laura Aina, Ionut Sorodoc"}}, {"model": "organization-projects.projectcontact", "pk": 59, "fields": {"project": null, "organization_name": "Universitat Pompeu Fabra", "position": "Tenure-track researcher"}}, {"model": "organization-projects.projectcontact", "pk": 46, "fields": {"project": null, "organization_name": "Univ.
