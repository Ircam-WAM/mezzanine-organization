The hardware component is a quasi-spherical robot using computationally controlled forces for power distribution, communication, adhesion (latching), and locomotion. The software approach aims to provide a new way of programming such a complex system through a scalable, real-time, efficient, expressive and at the same time safe programming of an ensemble of robots with an emphasis on self-configuration and self-reconfiguration distributed algorithms.  The application will use the robots to sculpt a shape-memory polymer sheet.", "technology_description": "As the design of the micro-robots composing programmable matter are not available yet, we have 3D printed bigger size elements, sticking with magnets.

We expect the artist to think about applications in the artistic field.\r\nSecond, we would like the artist to think of the link between virtual and real objects as thanks to programmable matter, an object being design inside a computer can be directly synchronized with a real object made from programmable matter. If the real object is modified, the virtual object will therefore be adapted.\r\nAs programmable matter is matter sculpted interactively by a program and a human, we think a plastic artist would be the best match.", "resources_description": "The artist will have an office with an internet connection in our laboratory and will take benefit of all the facilities in the Numerica building (professionnal stage for example more on http://www.sem-numerica.fr/index.php/activite/evenementiel).

Whenever the biomolecules reach a junction in the network, they either add a number to the sum they are calculating or leave it out. That way, each biomolecule acts as a tiny computer with processor and memory. While an individual biomolecule is much slower than a current computer, they are self-assembling so that they can be used in large numbers, quickly adding up their computing power.\r\nSpecific challenges are (1) to design error-free junctions, (2) to multiply the number of biomolecules to adapt to the difficulty of the problem, (3) to tag the biomolecules to know which path they have taken through the network.", "technology_description": "The artist is invited to discuss with the researchers in the project and follow experiments in state-of-the-art nanotechnology laboratories. In order to maximize the interaction of the artist and the project, we propose to start the collaboration during a workshop 12/13 September 2017. This will give a good overview of the research field. After that, the artist is invited to spend a week in each of three partner\u2019s laboratories: 1 week at TU Dresden, Germany where the focus is on fluorescence microscopy of biomolecular motors in nanostructures, 1 week at Fraunhofer ENAS (Chemnitz, Germany) where the focus is on nanofabrication of biocomputation chips, 1 week at Lund University and Linnaeus University (Lund and Kalmar, Sweden); where the focus is the design, nanofabrication and testing of biocomputation chips. The hosting project partners will provide office space, time for the artist to interact with the wider research environment at the respective site and demonstrate live experiments. The artist will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with observing biomolecular machines moving in various different nanostructures, (including imaging of multicolor fluorescence movies) and various techniques of nanofabrication.", "objectives_description": "The objective for the collaboration will be to get an outside perspective on our research. We hope to trigger new ideas for our research as well as learn new ways to communicate our research. This will help us to achieve a main goal of our project which is to attract and structure a larger interdisciplinary scientific and economic community to the field of network-based biocomputation. Since most of our research can only be visualized and experienced through some form of microscopy, an artist working with images will likely get the most out of the collaboration. Also, a mechanical/sculpture representation of biomolecules moving through artificial structures is possible.

The nanoparticles should be inhalable, biocompatible, biodegradable and must self-assemble to encapsulate drugs (novel or available) in a suitable format for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Several challenges are associated with the nanoparticle route: once inhaled, the nanoparticles should reach the deep lung, cross the pulmonary barrier and quickly reach the heart, where the drug will be finally released.

AMORE builds machines that connect language to reality, and seeks an understanding of how people do it.\r\n\r\nThe main challenges are: 1) identifying which entities (\"that big tree\") are being talked about, both on the visual and on the linguistic camps; 2) tracking the entities as they appear again, adding new information about them as needed; 3) learning these two abilities directly from examples.

By crunching thousands of examples, the model is able to generalize to situations it has never encountered.\r\n\r\nWe will give the artist access to the data we learn from, to the computational model itself (definition and software), to the answers the model gives for new data, and to our analyses of the model's behavior.
