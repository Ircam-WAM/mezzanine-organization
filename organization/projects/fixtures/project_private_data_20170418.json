This requires an understanding of the basic hardware units and methods to program the ensemble that scales up to millions of components. \r\nTo ensure that the hardware is possible, we will build an autonomous, centimetre-scale, mass-producible modular robot, using conventional and non-conventional fabrication techniques. In doing so, we aim to create the atomic unit of programmable matter that can be scaled to very large numbers of modules. We also aim to establish fundamental methods that will enable the manufacture of three-dimensional, freestanding centimeter-size-robots, and develop new methods for analysis for power transfer between capacitively coupled systems.\r\nThe realization of even a rudimentary implementation of programmable matter requires each robot to be able to perform some basic functions. In addition to computation, these functions include a mechanism to gather energy, since it would be better to avoid batteries in a large ensemble of robots. Another basic function is that each micro-robot should have the ability to latch onto its neighbours to create larger structures. These connections may also serve as a mean to communicate with neighbouring robots. Robots should also encompass an actuation mechanism, which will enable them to move within an ensemble, allowing the autonomous and dynamic formation of configurations. The goal of this work is to show that all of these functions can be implemented in an efficient way, using a single mechanism.\r\nThe individual unit, while interesting in its own right, is not particularly useful unless we can program it---and all the other units in the ensemble---to achieve a useful global goal. Previous approaches to this have often required the programmer to reason explicitly about the individual units, e.g., for synchronization, communication, memory mapping, etc. The resulting programs are often buggy, hard to maintain, and inefficient. Meld which is an implicitly parallel logic-based programming language that has been shown to be inherently fault tolerant, concise, expressive and efficient, will be the basis of our work. Meld has been used to create a generalized shape transformation algorithm; which was formally (and automatically) proven to be both sound and complete. Meld will be enhanced for the purpose of this project.\r\n\r\nThe application will consist in sculpting a sheet of a shape-memory polymer. Indeed, by moving relatively one to each other the modules will deform the polymer sheet put on top of them. This sheet will then be rigidified by changing the ambient temperature such that the final state will be kept. If the temperature is changed again, the polymer could be sculpted again. This could be an alternative to molding or 3D printing.", "affiliation": "Univ.

This approach is called \u201cnetwork-based biocomputation\u201d. Whenever the biomolecules reach a junction in the network, they can decide to take a turn, which adds a number to the sum they are calculating or to continue straight on, which does not add a number. That way, each biomolecule acts as a tiny computer with processor and memory. While an individual biomolecule is much slower than a current computer, they are self-assembling so that they can be used in large numbers, quickly adding up their computing power.\r\nAs said above, besides finding creative solutions for our research challenges, we are also expecting to make this rather narrow research field known to a wider public and to motivate more researchers to go into this research field. Two major goals of this project are: \r\n(i)\tto generate and structure a larger interdisciplinary community addressing theoretical and technological aspects and identifying future applications, and \r\n(ii)\tto develop a functional innovation eco-system that has the capability to address all levels of the value chain, from basic research to market success. \r\nThe tools that researchers have available are limited in the capacity to reach out (e.g. workshops are limited by number of participants, websites are only passive communication). Therefore, the public attention that follows with both, the artistic creation and the creation process, is extremely valuable for the success of generating a larger research community and a functional innovation ecosystem. \r\nThe specific research challenges are \r\n(1) to design the junctions in an error-free way: the networks are etched into silicon chips by electron beam lithography. At junctions it can happen, that biomolecules get stuck or only take one direction although two are possible (straight or turn). We believe that changes in the channel and junction geometries can improve the error rate. Also, we are looking into possibilities to include tunnels and overpasses so that the number of possible paths for the biomolecules is restricted. This will be done with 3D laser writing. Here, we propose the artist to work with TU Dresden and Fraunhofer ENAS in order to inspire artistic designs and channel/junction designs. \r\n(2) to find a possibility for increase the number of biomolecules during the passage through the network: with only one entrance the number of biomolecules that can be fed into the network is limited. However, the number of channels increases with increasing size of the network (which in turn reflects the complexity of the computation problem). Therefore we are exploring possibilities to cut or otherwise divide the biomolecules during the passage. Here, we propose the artist to work with Linnaeus University and TU Dresden to inspire each other. \r\n(3) to detect which of the biomolecules have taken a correct path through the network by a) chemical/physical detection methods and b) developing verification algorithms. If we e.g. look at the \u201ctravelling salesman\u201d problem, we want to make sure that the biomolecules have visited all \u201ctowns\u201d only once. Therefore, we are researching possibilities to mark the biomolecules in some way specific for each town visited. Here, we propose the artist to work with Lund University. Especially markers that can be detected by light/fluorescence microscopy have been discussed. As light and colour are important elements of art, we expect that both, the researchers and the artist will be inspired. Verification algorithms will be developed by partner Bar Ilan University. The algorithms could e.g. give an estimate of the time that biomolecules must spend in the network if they have explored the network in a correct way. Interaction between the artist and these researchers would probably be in connection to the workshop in September. \r\nPictures to give impressions of the researcher\u00b4s work environment can be found on the website bio4comp.eu. \r\nSome of the researchers in the project team have collaborated with artists before and have reported that this was a very positive experience.

The focus is on the development of learning technologies for children solidly grounded on neuroscientific, psychophysical, and pedagogical evidence. A very relevant objective for weDRAW is to exploit art (with a particular focus on music and drawing) for teaching arithmetic and geometry to primary school children.\r\nweDRAW comes from the renewed neuroscientific understanding of the role of communication between sensory modalities during development: specific sensory systems have specific roles to learn specific concepts. Starting from these results, the project is developing a multisensory technology that will exploit the best sensory modality for learning arithmetic and geometric concepts. The major outputs of the project will be three serious games, based on such novel technology. \r\nIn particular, weDRAW:\r\n- will provide teachers with the elements to determine which is the best modality (visual, audio or haptic) to teach each specific concept to each student;\r\n- will provide the technology to exploit the best sensory signal for each concept and for each student;\r\n- will enable to teach different concepts together: this will be possible by adopting a multisensory approach, supporting a new teaching/learning channel, personalized for each student, and grounded on multisensory interactive technology (i.e., audio, tactile, motor and visual), including a serious game platform;\r\n- will show that students can learn arithmetic concepts from multisensory exploration of rhythm and music and geometric concepts from body movement and multisensory drawing;\r\n- will enable a \"deeper learning of Science and Mathematics combined with Arts\", aiming at improving the creative capacities of learners.\r\nBesides application to typical children, a major goal and output of weDRAW consists of applying the proposed multisensory approach and technologies to two specific populations: visually impaired and dyslexic children. In particular, dyslexic children have problems with rhythm, whereas visually impaired children have problems with space and geometry.

The chronic treatment of patients leads only to short-term benefits due to several weak points typical of conventional therapies (side-effects, reduced efficacy, invasive administration). The field needs fresh approaches to discover novel patient-friendly therapies that are more efficient, safer and heart-specific. The EU-funded project CUPIDO started in February 2017, proposes to apply nanotechnologies to the cardiovascular field. CUPIDO aims to hit the core of the cardiovascular disease, developing inhalable nanoparticles that can deliver as simple as breathing a therapeutic directly to the diseased heart. To achieve the goal, the CUPIDO consortium is working to develop biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles that can self-assemble and encapsulate drugs, novel or available, in a suitable format for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The route of the nanoparticles is quite complex and includes several stages:\r\n\r\n1.\tNanoparticle preparation:  the selected particles are negatively charged calcium phosphate CaP nanoparticles that can encapsulate bioactive molecules and function as an effective drug-delivery system through the formation of life-compatible nanopores that allow cellular internalization. Nanoparticles are generated through an easy and self-assembling process consisting of the mixing of two saline solutions followed by a washing step via dialysis. \r\n\r\n2.\tNano-embedded microparticle production, inhalation, and lung deposition: unlike nano-sized materials (1 nm - 1\u00b5m), particles in the range between 1-3 \u00b5m can be efficiently deposited at the alveolar level. CaPs will, therefore, be transformed into a microparticle dry powder that can be easily inhaled and reach the deep lung.\r\n\r\n3.\tNano-embedded microparticle dissolution in the lung, nanoparticle release and translocation to the heart: once inhaled the microparticles can dissolve in the lung fluid. During respiration, the oxygenated blood moves from the pulmonary circulation first to the heart via the pulmonary vein. In line with this, the inhaled CaPs able to cross the alveolar-capillary barrier would rapidly reach the myocardium. \r\n\r\n4.\tMonitoring and guidance to the heart: the fate of CaPs and the effective biodistribution will be monitored in vivo through radio- and fluorescence-labeling to select the most promising delivery systems. To achieve selective drug delivery to myocardial cells and reduce the adverse side effects, CUPIDO will implement aptamers as cardiac-specific carriers and magnetic guidance applying a stable magnetic field.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, CUPIDO will address cardiovascular diseases associated with structural and functional impairment of the myocardium presenting a reduced systolic function (i.e. Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction - HFrEF). Treatments will first be evaluated in a mouse model of HFrEF and the most effective formulation for therapeutic delivery will be then applied to an HFrEF model in mini-pigs. The EU-based consortium, composed of 6 academic research groups, 5 SMEs, 2 industries, and 1 pharmaceutical company, gathers a vast array of expertise and joins cutting-edge research with pre-clinical experience and industrial manufacturing.

The ability to\r\nuse language to refer to reality is crucial for humans, and yet it is\r\nvery difficult to model. AMORE breaks new ground in Computational\r\nLinguistics, Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence by developing a\r\nmodel of linguistic reference to entities implemented as a\r\ncomputational system that can learn its own representations from data.\r\n\r\nReference is both fuzzy and discrete. When we refer to an object in\r\nthe world with the linguistic expression \"the mug I bought\", we use\r\ncontent words such as \"mug\", which are notoriously fuzzy or vague in\r\ntheir meaning. Once the referent for the mug has been established,\r\nhowever, it becomes a linguistic entity that we can manipulate in a\r\nlargely discrete fashion, retrieving it and updating it with new\r\ninformation as needed (\"remember the mug I bought? My brother stole\r\nit!\"). Thus, handling reference requires two distinct abilities:\r\n\r\n1) The ability to categorize, that is, to recognize that different\r\nentities are equivalent with regard to some parameter of interest (for\r\ninstance, two mugs, or two instances of the \"things to take on a\r\ncamping trip\" category). This implies being able to put diverse things\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n2) The ability to individuate, that is, to keep entities\r\ndistinct even if they are similar with regard to many properties\r\n(for instance, two pieces of pink granite that were collected in different\r\nnational parks). This implies being able to keep similar things apart.\r\n\r\nOur project builds on two complementary traditions, each exceling at\r\none of the two aspects while struggling with the other one. AMORE\r\nsynthesizes the two approaches into a unified model that emulates both\r\nfuzzy and discrete properties of language, and is able to learn to\r\nrefer directly from examples.\r\n\r\nThe model is a computer program that is able to carry out referential\r\ntasks, matching linguistic expressions (\"the Medicine student\", \"the\r\nwhite cat\") with entities in the real world such as objects depicted\r\nin images. We obtain it using Machine Learning. Computer programs tell\r\ncomputers how to carry out tasks, as if you gave a recipe to your\r\nneighbor and he baked a cake by following the instructions. Machine\r\nLearning enables computers to learn the recipe themselves by\r\nobservation, as if your neighbor watched you baking a cake and then\r\nmade one himself back at home.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in AMORE we give the computer a collection of images\r\ndepicting different entities (say, two boys and one table), and we\r\ntell it that if we ask for \"the table\" it should retrieve the image of\r\nthe table, but if we ask for \"the boy\" it should complain that we\r\ndidn't get our language right, because there are two boys. By\r\ncrunching thousands of examples, the model is able to generalize to\r\nsituations it has never encountered.\r\n\r\nAMORE is organized into three main parts:\r\n\r\n1) Developing the model. The main novelty is the use of a memory\r\nmodule to dynamically add entity representations as they are\r\nencountered in language and in visual input, update them, and retrieve\r\nthem as needed.\r\n\r\n2) Testing it in referential tasks involving only language. For\r\ninstance, given a story that starts \"Bob is a Law student, but Ann\r\nstudies Medicine\", and then goes on to talk about Mark and Barbara and\r\nwhat happens to all of these characters, the system should output\r\n\"Ann\" in response to the question \"Who is the Medicine student?\".\r\n\r\n3) Testing it in referential tasks involving language and perception,\r\nspecifically vision. For instance, we give the computer a collection\r\nof images depicting different entities (say, two boys and one table),\r\nand we tell it that if we ask for \"the table\" it should retrieve the\r\nimage of the table, but if we ask for \"the boy\" it should complain\r\nthat we didn't get our language right, because there are two boys.\r\n\r\nAMORE advances our scientific understanding of language and its\r\ncomputational modeling, and contributes to the far-reaching debate\r\nbetween discrete and fuzzy approaches to cognition with an\r\nintegrative proposal.", "affiliation": "Universitat Pompeu Fabra", "commitment_letter": "user/documents/2017/04/10/letter-commitment-vertigo_loc_v3.pdf", "persons": "Gemma Boleda, Louise McNally, Carina Silberer, Matthijs Westera, Laura Aina, Ionut Sorodoc"}}]
