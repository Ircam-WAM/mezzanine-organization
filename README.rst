Install
=======

Clone
++++++

On Linux, first install Git_, Docker-engine_ and docker-compose_ and open a terminal.

On MacOS or Windows install Git_ and the Docker-Toolbox_ and open a Docker Quickstart Terminal.

Then run these commands::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/mezzanine-organization.git


Start
+++++

Our docker composition already bundles some powerful containers and bleeding edge frameworks like: Nginx, MySQL, Redis, Celery, Django and Python. It thus provides a safe and continuous way to deploy your project from an early development stage to a massive production environment.

For a production environment setup::

    cd mezzanine-organization
    docker-compose up

which builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches all containers.

Then browse the app at http://localhost:8020/

On MacOS or Windows, we need to replace 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal.

.. warning :: Before any serious production usecase, you *must* modify all the passwords and secret keys in the configuration files of the sandbox.


Daemonize
+++++++++++

The install the entire composition so that it will be automatically run at boot and in the background::

    sudo bin/install.py

options::

    --uninstall : uninstall the daemon
    --cron : install cron backup rule (every 6 hours)
    --user : specify user for cron rule
    --systemd : use systemd
    --composition_file : the path of the YAML composition file to use (optional)

This will install a init script in /etc/init.d. For example, if your app directory is named `mezzanine-organization` then `/etc/init.d/mezzanine-organization` becomes the init script for the OS booting procedure and for you if you need to start the daemon by hand::

    sudo /etc/init.d/mezzanine-organization start

Development
===========

Dev mode
+++++++++

For a development environment setup::

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f env/dev.yml up

This will launch the django development server. Then browse the app at http://localhost:9020/

On MacOS or Windows, we need to replace 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal.

.. warning :: In this mode, Django is run with the `runserver` tool in DEBUG mode. NEVER use this in production!


Back
+++++

If you modify or add django models, you can produce migration files with::

    bin/makemigrations.sh

To apply new migrations::

    bin/migrate.sh

Accessing the app container shell::

    docker-compose run app bash


Front
+++++

The styles are written in SASS in app/static and the builder uses Gulp.
All the builing tools are included in the app container so that you can build the front in one command::

    bin/build_font.sh

To start the gulp server to get dynamic builing::

    docker-compose run app gulp serve

Gulp will launch BrowserSync. BrowserSync is a middleware that expose the website on port 3000.
Any change on CSS or JS files will trigger the build system and reload the browser.
Maintenance
============

Log
++++

- var/log/nginx/app-access.log \
    nginx access log of the app
- var/log/nginx/app-error.log \
    nginx error log of the app
- var/log/uwsgi/app.log \
    uwsgi log of the app


Backup & restore
+++++++++++++++++

To backup the database and all the media, this will push all of them to the var submodule own repository::

    bin/push.sh

.. warning :: use this ONLY from the **production** environment!

To restore the backuped the database, all the media and rebuild front ()::

    bin/pull.sh

.. warning :: use this ONLY from the **development** environment!


Upgrade
+++++++++

Upgrade application, all dependencies, data from master branch and also recompile assets::

    bin/upgrade.sh


Repair
+++++++

If the app is not accessible, first try to restart the composition with::

    docker-compose restart

If the app is not responding yet, try to restart the docker service and then the app::

    docker-compose stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
    docker-compose up

If the containers are still broken, try to delete exisiting containers (this will NOT delete critical data as database or media)::

    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose rm
    docker-compose up

In case you have installed the init script to run the app as a daemon (cf. section "Daemonize"), you can use it to restart the app:

    /etc/init.d/mezzanine-organization restart

If you need more informations about running containers::

    docker-compose ps

Or more, inspecting any container of the composition (usefully to know IP of a container)::

    docker inspect [CONTAINER_ID]
